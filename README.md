# MLS_Database_System
 MLS (multi-level secure) Database System so that you can return the results from SQL queries to an MLS database.

Implementation of operations required by an MLS SQL query with the ability to execute them on preexisting files, each of which corresponds to a table in a database. 
Contains code for select, project, Cartesian product and join operations. The result from querys will also depend on the classification level of the user issuing the query.
